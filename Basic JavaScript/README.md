In the first course of nine total courses within freeCodeCamp's **__JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Track__**, I learned these fundamental concepts through 113 modules of challenges:
- Basic data structures
- Arrays / Array manipulation
- Objects
- Functions
- Loops
- If/else statements
- Recursion

The .js file within this folder contains all my written code solutions for the challenges within this module, commented with the learning objective of each module or the requirements of certain coding challenges in the module.
