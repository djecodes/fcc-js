# Regular Expressions

In the third course of nine total courses within freeCodeCamp's **JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Track**, I learned the importance of utilizing Regular expressions to help match, search, and replace text through 33 modules of challenges which covered concepts such as:
- Using `test` method
- Matching literal strings
- Ignore Case while matching
- Extracting matches
- Wildcard period
- Matching characters that occur one or more times
- Finding characters with Lazy Matching
- Positive and Negative lookahead
- Removing whitespace from strings

The `.js` file contains all my written code solutions for the challenges within this module, commented with the learning objectives of each module as well as the requirements for the coding challenges.
