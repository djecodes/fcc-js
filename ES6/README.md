In the second course of nine total courses within freeCodeCamp's **JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Track**, I learned these ES6 concepts through 29 modules of challenges:
- Scope difference between `var` and `let`
- Mutating arrays declared with `const`
- Arrow Functions
- Setting Default parameters
- Using the Rest parameter
- Using the Spread operator
- Using Destructuring Assignments on Objects, nested Objects, Arrays, and to pass an object as a function's parameters
- Template literals
- Object property shorthand for declaring Object literal
- `class` syntax
- Using `get` and `set` to control access to an Object
- Creating a Module Script
- Using `export` to share a code block
- Using `import`
- JavaScript promises

The `.js` file within this folder contains all my written code solutions for the challenges within this module, commented with the learning objectives of each module as well as the requirements for the coding challenges.
