In the fourth course of nine total courses within freeCodeCamp's **JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Track**, I learned these important debugging concepts through 12 modules of challenges:

- Using the in-browser console and DevTools
- Using typeof to check the type of a variable
- Catching common typos within code such as:
  - Misspelled variable and function names
  - Unclosed parentheses, brackets, braces and quotes
  - Mixed usage of single and double quotes
- Preventing infinite loops with a valid terminal condition
